# Rhyzzle — Progress Log

Every Claude Code session must append a new entry to this file before finishing.

---

## Session 1 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Create the complete project foundation. Nothing existed before this session.

**What was done:**

### Documentation
- Created `README.md` — setup instructions, project structure, commands
- Created `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` — product vision, core loop, game modes, principles, MVP scope
- Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` — tech stack, data model, route overview, state machine, auth strategy
- Created `ROADMAP.md` — Phases 0–6 with full task breakdowns
- Created `TASKS.md` — actionable task list with status labels, acceptance criteria, and file references
- Created `PROGRESS.md` (this file)
- Created `DECISIONS.md` — 10 key product and technical decisions documented
- Created `AGENTS.md` — permanent instructions for future Claude Code sessions

### Configuration
- Created `package.json` — Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma, all deps
- Created `tsconfig.json` — strict TypeScript config
- Created `next.config.ts` — minimal Next.js config
- Created `tailwind.config.ts` — dark theme, mobile-first config
- Created `postcss.config.mjs` — Tailwind postcss setup
- Created `.env.example` — all required environment variables documented
- Created `.gitignore` — Node, Next.js, Prisma, env files excluded

### Database Schema
- Created `prisma/schema.prisma` — full schema with 20+ models:
  - `User`, `GuestUser` — auth (real + guest)
  - `Group`, `GroupMember` — crew rooms (future)
  - `Beat` — audio tracks
  - `Challenge`, `ChallengeRule`, `RequiredWord` — challenge system
  - `Room`, `RoomParticipant` — room sessions
  - `Submission`, `SubmissionLine` — bars + lines
  - `Vote`, `Like`, `Comment`, `Save`, `ShareEvent` — engagement
  - `DailyChallenge` — daily game
  - `HighlightSpan`, `ConstraintResult` — Phase 5 AI highlighting (designed now, used later)

### Sample Data
- Created `lib/sample-data.ts` — 5 sample beats, 10 challenge templates (4-bar, 6-bar, 8-bar), 1 test room
- Created `prisma/seed.ts` — database seeder

### App Pages (Placeholder UI)
- Created `app/layout.tsx` — root layout with dark theme
- Created `app/globals.css` — Tailwind base + CSS vars
- Created `app/page.tsx` — landing page: pitch, CTA, how-it-works steps
- Created `app/create/page.tsx` — create room form (beat, bar count, rules, privacy)
- Created `app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx` — room experience with state machine (LOBBY/WRITING/VOTING/REVEAL)
- Created `app/daily/page.tsx` — daily challenge placeholder
- Created `app/discover/page.tsx` — discover feed placeholder
- Created `app/profile/page.tsx` — profile placeholder

### API Route Stubs
- Created `app/api/rooms/route.ts` — POST create room
- Created `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/route.ts` — GET room state
- Created `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/join/route.ts` — POST join room
- Created `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/submit/route.ts` — POST submit bars
- Created `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/vote/route.ts` — POST cast vote

### Components
- Created `components/beat-player.tsx` — audio beat player
- Created `components/bar-editor.tsx` — line-by-line bar writing editor
- Created `components/challenge-card.tsx` — challenge rules display

### Lib
- Created `lib/types.ts` — all shared TypeScript types and DTOs
- Created `lib/utils.ts` — room code generation, score calculation, cn() helper

**Status after this session:**
Phase 0 complete. App runs (`pnpm dev`) and shows placeholder UI. Database schema is ready but database is not yet connected (requires `.env.local` with `DATABASE_URL`). All foundation docs are in place. All future sessions should read AGENTS.md first.

**Next 5 tasks (Phase 1):**
1. Connect a local PostgreSQL database and run `pnpm db:push`
2. Run `pnpm db:seed` to load sample beats and challenges
3. Implement `POST /api/rooms` — create room, persist to DB, return roomCode
4. Make `/create` form functional (fetch beats from DB, submit creates room)
5. Implement `POST /api/rooms/[roomCode]/join` and make LOBBY state work with real data

*Append new entries below as work continues.*

## Session 18 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Improve inline highlight precision, rhyme detection, metaphor phrase extraction, and add a colorful post-submit preview card.

**What was done:**

### Part 1 — Inline highlight precision (`lib/rule-checks/deterministic.ts`, `lib/rule-checks/ai-placeholder.ts`)
- Required words: already highlighted exact word occurrence — no change needed; confirmed working
- End rhymes: `checkEndRhymePair` always highlights the end word of both lines (not whole-line)
- Alliteration: `checkAlliteration` highlights each alliterating word individually as a separate span
- Theme reference: highlights the matched keyword inline
- All highlights are character-precise with correct `startIndex`/`endIndex`; safe clamping in `HighlightedText`

### Part 2 — Better rhyme detection (`lib/rule-checks/deterministic.ts`)
- Replaced `simpleRhymes(a, b): boolean` with `wordsLikelyRhyme(a, b): RhymeResult` (exported for reuse)
- Three-level approach:
  - **Level 1**: exact rhyme key match → PASS (night/fight, pain/rain, gold/cold)
  - **Level 1.5**: deduplicated key (me/free → "e"/"e" → PASS; o/oo handling)
  - **Level 2**: same phoneme group → NEEDS_REVIEW (window/tempo → OH group, gold/home → OH group, flow/go → OH group)
  - **Level 3**: same last 2 chars of word → NEEDS_REVIEW
- New helpers: `normalizeWord()`, `stripSilentE()` ("home"→"hom" for correct key), `getRhymeKey()`, `getPhonemeGroup()` (OH/AY/EE/EYE/OO/ER/AW groups)
- `checkEndRhymePair` and `checkChainRhyme` updated to use `wordsLikelyRhyme`; status now PASS/NEEDS_REVIEW/MISSING instead of boolean

### Part 3 — Metaphor phrase extraction (`lib/rule-checks/ai-placeholder.ts`)
- Added `extractPhraseAround(line, patStart, patEnd)` helper
  - Extends backward to clause start (line start or after `[.!?;]`)
  - Extends forward up to 4 content words (stops at prepositions/conjunctions)
- `checkMetaphor` now highlights the full figurative clause, not just the trigger pattern
  - "My heart is a locked room with gold on the floor" → highlights "My heart is a locked room" (green)
  - Previously would have only highlighted "is a" (4 chars)
- Simile patterns ("like a", "feel like") vs metaphor patterns ("is a", "was a", "I'm a", "turns into") correctly distinguished

### Part 4 — Post-submit preview (`app/play/[barCount]/page.tsx`)
- `handleSubmit()` now calls `runRuleChecks(barLines, challenge)` client-side immediately
- Converts `ComputedHighlightSpan[]` → `SubmissionLineDTO[]` using `CATEGORY_COLOR` for DB-compatible format
- Replaces the plain "Your bars" text list with `SubmissionPatternCard` (colorful rows, scheme letters, rule chips, inline highlights)
- Note below card: "Rhyzzle checks the pattern, not quality. Humans still vote who cooked."
- Non-fatal: if `runRuleChecks` throws, preview falls back to bars with no highlights (submission always works)

### Live hint update (`lib/rule-checks/live-checks.ts`)
- Rhyme hint now distinguishes three cases:
  - PASS → "Rhyme connected ✓" (green, status = looks_good)
  - NEEDS_REVIEW → "Possible slant rhyme ~" (green, status = looks_good — slant is valid in rap)
  - MISSING → "Connect to '[end word]'" (amber, status = needs_review)

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean, zero errors.

**Test scenario — expected results for 6-bar:**
```
Line 1: I kept my dreams folded deep inside the window
Line 2: Winter in my chest but I still kept the tempo
→ "window"/"tempo": NEEDS_REVIEW (both OH group) → "Possible slant rhyme ~" ✓
→ "window": gold REQUIRED_WORD highlight ✓

Line 3: My heart is a locked room with gold on the floor
→ "My heart is a locked room" highlighted green (metaphor phrase) ✓
→ "gold": gold REQUIRED_WORD highlight ✓

Line 4: I turned the static into speakers they could not ignore
→ "floor"/"ignore": both end in "or" → PASS ✓ (end rhyme highlights)
→ "static": gold REQUIRED_WORD highlight ✓

Line 5: Cold city corners couldn't close me
→ alliteration on 'C': "Cold", "city", "corners", "couldn", "close" highlighted orange ✓

Line 6: Now I own the view from that same old window
→ "window": gold REQUIRED_WORD highlight ✓
```

**Post-submit:** After submitting, the plain text list is replaced by the full colorful pattern card with all inline spans computed client-side.

**Known limitations:**
- "pressure"/"dresser" not detected (requires phonetic dictionary) — by design
- "gold"/"home" = NEEDS_REVIEW only (not PASS) — acceptable for heuristic
- "again"/"pen" = MISSING — very loose slant, acceptable
- Simile ("like a") shown as PASS in the heuristic but labeled separately in explanation
- Metaphor phrase extraction can occasionally capture too little or too much text near punctuation — Phase 5B AI will fix

## Session 17 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Fix Prisma "Argument `beat` is missing" runtime error on Challenge Friends room creation, and polish the writing canvas so rows have full color identity while typing.

**What was done:**

### Bug fix — `app/api/rooms/route.ts`
- Added explicit `beatId: null` and `challengeId: null` to `tx.room.create` data object
- Root cause: Prisma 6's `XOR<RoomCreateInput, RoomUncheckedCreateInput>` type — without explicit nulls, the engine couldn't resolve which input union branch to use at runtime and fell back to requiring the `beat` relation object. Explicit nulls pin it to `RoomUncheckedCreateInput`.
- All three room creation paths affected (DAILY_CHALLENGE, CHALLENGE_LINK, custom beatId/challengeId)
- Schema was correct; no migration needed — `pnpm db:push` already confirmed "database is already in sync"

### Canvas color polish — `lib/lyric-meta.ts`
- Added three new fields to `C` palette type: `textDark`, `rowFocused`, `gutterFocused`
- All 8 colors defined: `rowFocused`/`gutterFocused` = one shade darker bg (bg-*-100); `textDark` = very dark color-tinted text (text-*-950, zinc uses text-zinc-700)
- Purpose: each row now has full color identity whether empty, unfocused, or focused

### Canvas rewrite — `components/lyric-puzzle-canvas.tsx`
- Added `FOCUS_STRIP` and `CANVAS_BORDER_FOCUSED` constant maps (`Record<LineColor, string>`)
- Added `focusedLine: number | null` state — tracked via `onFocus`/`onBlur` on each input
- `focusedColor` derived from active line's chip color
- Canvas card border now follows focused line color (via `CANVAS_BORDER_FOCUSED[focusedColor]`); `border-green-400/40` when all filled; `border-transparent` when unfocused
- Each row: `relative` positioned, always uses `col.row` / `col.rowFocused` (never plain white fallback)
- Focus strip: absolute 3px left strip inside the row, colored with `FOCUS_STRIP[m.chip.color]` — appears only on focused row
- Gutter: always `col.gutter` / `col.gutterFocused` — no grey fallback even when empty
- Scheme badge in gutter: always `col.chip col.text` — no grey fallback
- Input text: `col.textDark` — dark color-tinted, readable on light bg (e.g., amber-950 on yellow-50)

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean, zero errors.

**What changed visually:**
- Writing canvas rows are always color-tinted, never plain white
- Focused row gets a visible left strip (3px color accent) and slightly darker background
- Canvas card border changes color to match whichever line is active
- Typed text is dark color-tinted (not default zinc/black) — each bar feels tied to its scheme slot

**Key constraints preserved:**
- Live hint system unchanged (debounced 300ms, required word chips, rhyme hints, alliteration feedback)
- No AI calls, no submission blocking
- Ranked voting flow untouched

## Session 16 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Phase 5A.2 — add live editor indicators to LyricPuzzleCanvas. As the user writes bars, the canvas shows lightweight in-editor guidance without blocking submission or calling AI.

**What was done:**

### `lib/rule-checks/live-checks.ts` (new)
- `LineStatus = "empty" | "in_progress" | "looks_good" | "needs_review"`
- `LineHint` — per-line: ruleHint string, rhymeHint string, isSubjectiveRule flag, status
- `RequiredWordStatus` — per-required-word: found/missing
- `LiveCheckState` — requiredWords + lineHints arrays
- `runLiveChecks(lines, challenge) → LiveCheckState` — pure client-safe function:
  - Required words: per-word whole-word regex scan across all lines
  - Effective rule per line: same priority logic as `buildMeta` (reuses `RULE_PRI`)
  - Alliteration: calls `checkAlliteration` → "3 words on 'S' ✓" or "Try more same-starting words"
  - Metaphor: calls `checkMetaphor` → "Pattern detected" or falls back to `isSubjectiveRule = true`
  - Subjective rules (punchline, callback, assonance, internal rhyme): `isSubjectiveRule = true`
  - Chain rhyme: calls `checkChainRhyme` once partner line has text
  - Theme reference: calls `checkThemeReference`
  - Rhyme hint: finds partner line (same scheme letter) with text, calls `checkEndRhymePair` → "Rhyme connected ✓" or "Connect to 'word'"
  - All logic reuses existing deterministic/ai-placeholder check functions — zero duplication

### `components/lyric-puzzle-canvas.tsx`
- Imports `runLiveChecks` + `LiveCheckState` from `lib/rule-checks/live-checks`
- `useState` initialized with `runLiveChecks(lines, challenge)` — correct state from mount
- `useEffect` debounced 300ms: recomputes `liveState` when `lines` changes
- **Required word chips**: updated to show `✓ word` in green when found, amber when missing — live, no page reload
- **Per-row chip row**: adds live status indicator text after chip/rhyme link:
  - `ruleHint` shown in green (looks_good) or amber (needs_review)
  - "→ submit" italic zinc label when `isSubjectiveRule` and no other hint
  - Nothing shown on empty lines (no clutter)
- **Below input**: `rhymeHint` line in green (connected) or amber (not yet) — only appears once partner line has text
- **Guidance note** below canvas: `"Live hints are guides. Humans still vote who cooked."`

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean, zero errors.

**Checks that run client-side (live):**
- Required word scan (deterministic, fast)
- Alliteration detection (heuristic, ~0.85 confidence)
- Metaphor pattern matching (heuristic, ~0.65 confidence)
- Chain rhyme (heuristic, ~0.8 confidence)
- Theme reference (keyword match, ~0.7 confidence)
- End rhyme pair (heuristic vowel-nucleus, ~0.8 confidence)

**Checks that wait until submit (server-side):**
- Punchline — too subjective for local heuristic
- Callback — requires semantic comparison, marked NEEDS_REVIEW
- Assonance — requires phonetic analysis, marked NEEDS_REVIEW
- Internal rhyme — weak heuristic only, full check on server
- HighlightSpan storage — always server-side (Prisma writes)
- ConstraintResult storage — always server-side

**Key constraints honored:**
- No AI calls while typing
- No blocking of submission
- No false certainty for subjective rules
- Ranked voting flow untouched

---

## Session 15 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Build the Phase 5 constraint engine + lyric highlight rendering system. Run rule checks on submission and display colored highlights in SubmissionPatternCard.

**What was done:**

### `lib/rule-checks/types.ts` (new)
- `RuleCheckStatus = "PASS" | "NEEDS_REVIEW" | "MISSING"` — never blocks submission
- `ComputedHighlightSpan` — lineIndex, startIndex, endIndex, category, confidence, explanation
- `RuleCheckResult` — ruleType, lineIndex, status, confidence, explanation, highlights
- `RunChecksOutput` — results + allHighlights (flat list of all span data)
- `CATEGORY_COLOR` — maps HighlightCategory → color name string for DB storage

### `lib/rule-checks/deterministic.ts` (new)
- `checkLineCount` — PASS/MISSING with confidence 1.0
- `checkRequiredWords` — word-boundary regex, highlights each found word as REQUIRED_WORD; MISSING per absent word
- `checkAlliteration` — most-common first-letter heuristic across content words (len > 2), PASS at 2+ matching, confidence 0.85
- `checkEndRhymePair` — vowel-nucleus rhyme heuristic, highlights end words as END_RHYME
- `checkRhymeScheme` — groups scheme letters, runs pair checks, reports per-group
- `checkChainRhyme` — first word of line N vs last word of line N-1
- `checkThemeReference` — keyword + stem word search in theme string

### `lib/rule-checks/ai-placeholder.ts` (new)
- `checkMetaphor` — detects simile/metaphor pattern strings (`like a`, `as a`, `is a`), PASS at confidence 0.65 if found, NEEDS_REVIEW otherwise
- `checkPunchline` — always NEEDS_REVIEW (too subjective for deterministic), weak heuristic for `!?` / slang
- `checkCallback` — shared content-word detection between lines, NEEDS_REVIEW
- `checkInternalRhyme` — last-2-chars matching for non-adjacent words, NEEDS_REVIEW
- `checkAssonance` — always NEEDS_REVIEW, TODO Phase 5B
- All these are designed to be replaced by actual AI calls in Phase 5B

### `lib/rule-checks/run-rule-checks.ts` (new)
- Orchestrator that runs all applicable checks given `lines: string[]` + `ChallengeDTO`
- Always runs: line count, required words
- Per ConstraintType: routes to appropriate deterministic or AI-placeholder check
- Uses `deriveScheme()` from `lib/lyric-meta` for rhyme scheme detection
- Returns `{ results, allHighlights }` — no AI calls, no API keys required

### `lib/utils.ts`
- Added `HIGHLIGHT_COLORS_LIGHT` — 10-category color map for white-background cards (className + label per category)

### `components/highlighted-text.tsx` (new)
- Renders a line of text with colored inline spans
- Sorts spans by startIndex, skips out-of-bounds
- First span wins on overlap (later overlapping spans skipped)
- Falls back to plain text for unknown categories
- Uses `HIGHLIGHT_COLORS_LIGHT` from utils

### `components/submission-pattern-card.tsx`
- Updated bar text rendering to use `HighlightedText` component instead of plain `<p>`
- Passes `line?.highlightSpans ?? []` to HighlightedText

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/submit/route.ts`
- Imports `runRuleChecks` + `CATEGORY_COLOR`
- Fetches `challengeSnapshot` from room
- Creates submission (+ lines) then runs rule checks (pure computation — no DB access in checks)
- Persists `ConstraintResult` rows + `HighlightSpan` rows non-fatally (bug in saving must not break the submission)
- Submission returned to client regardless of whether check-saving succeeds

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/route.ts`
- Prisma query: now includes `highlightSpans` on each line (ordered by startIndex)
- Added `toSpanDTO()` helper mapping DB row → `HighlightSpanDTO`
- Both CHALLENGE_LINK and GROUP_ROOM submission builders now include real spans instead of `[]`

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean, zero errors.

**Key constraints honored:**
- No AI scoring of creative quality (see DECISIONS.md)
- No API key required — all checks are deterministic or heuristic locally
- Submission is never blocked by rule check failures
- Humans still vote who cooked; AI only detects pattern compliance

**Known limitations / Phase 5B work:**
- Metaphor, punchline, callback, internal rhyme, assonance are heuristic placeholders — designed to be replaced with AI model calls
- CHALLENGE_LINK room creation (`POST /api/rooms`) submits creator's bars but does NOT run rule checks on them (TODO in that route)
- Live editor highlights (while typing) not yet implemented

---

## Session 14 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Create a copyright-free synthetic placeholder beat so BeatPlayer can actually play audio during MVP testing.

**What was done:**

### `public/beats/brooklyn-bounce.wav` (new)
- Generated entirely with Python stdlib (`wave`, `math`, `array`, `random`) — no ffmpeg, no external deps, no copyrighted audio
- 24 seconds, 92 BPM, 44100 Hz, 16-bit signed PCM, mono, ~2 MB
- Simple kick/snare/hi-hat pattern in 4/4:
  - Kick: beats 1 & 3 — sine sweep (150→55 Hz) with exponential amplitude decay
  - Snare: beats 2 & 4 — white noise + 200 Hz body tone
  - Hi-hat: every 8th note (closed); open hat on "and of 2"

### `lib/daily-challenge.ts`
- `audioUrl`: `/beats/brooklyn-bounce.mp3` → `/beats/brooklyn-bounce.wav`
- `durationSec`: 175 → 24 (matches the actual generated file)
- Added comment noting it is a placeholder and how to replace

### `public/beats/README.md`
- Updated to document the WAV as a placeholder
- Instructions for swapping in a licensed mp3 when ready

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean.

**To replace with a real beat:** drop `public/beats/brooklyn-bounce.mp3`, update `audioUrl` and `durationSec` in `lib/daily-challenge.ts`, delete the WAV.

---

## Session 13 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Make BeatPlayer play real audio. Add graceful missing-file state so the app doesn't silently fail when no mp3 is present.

**What was done:**

### `components/beat-player.tsx`
- Added `AudioState = "idle" | "loading" | "ready" | "error"` type
- Listens to `loadstart` → "loading", `loadedmetadata`/`canplay` → "ready", `error` → "error"
- Also checks `audio.error` synchronously in useEffect to catch files that 404 before listeners attach
- Play button: disabled + dimmed in "loading" and "error" states; shows ⏳ while loading
- Seek range: disabled unless state is "ready"
- Duration display: shows "—:——" while loading
- Badge row: shows "Loading…" chip while loading; "🔁 LOOP" chip when ready; "Unavailable" chip in red when error
- **Error state**: replaces waveform section with a red card: "Beat file missing" + `public/beats/<filename>` (filename extracted from `beat.audioUrl`, not hardcoded)
- `togglePlay()`: catches `play()` rejection and sets error state (handles cases where metadata loaded but file can't play)
- No design changes — visual identity preserved

### `public/beats/README.md` (new)
- Documents where to place mp3 files
- Lists the required filename (`brooklyn-bounce.mp3`) and which file references it
- Notes on CDN hosting for files > 10 MB
- Notes that copyrighted audio must not be committed

**Beat URL:** `lib/daily-challenge.ts` already points to `/beats/brooklyn-bounce.mp3` — correct, no change needed.

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean.

**Known limitations:**
- `preload="metadata"` fetches file headers but not the full file — on slow connections the play button may still be briefly disabled after first tap while the browser buffers
- No loading spinner animation (hourglass emoji only)
- Cover art (`/beats/covers/brooklyn-bounce.jpg`) is not wired up — falls back to emoji

---

## Session 12 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Improve error recovery for the solo play → Challenge Friends → room creation flow. Prevent users from getting stuck after a failed API call. Improve server-side error messages.

**What was done:**

### `app/api/rooms/route.ts`
- Replaced generic `"Internal server error"` catch with specific cases:
  - Prisma P2002 (unique constraint): `"Room code collision — please try again"`
  - Prisma P1001/P1017 (DB unreachable/closed): `"Database connection failed — check the DB is running"`
  - In development (`NODE_ENV === "development"`): returns the real `err.message` so the exact failure is visible
  - Production fallback: `"Failed to create challenge room — please try again"` (actionable, not opaque)
- Server-side log unchanged: full error still logged via `console.error`

### `app/play/[barCount]/page.tsx`
- Replaced flat error `<p>` with a full recovery card when `challengeError` is set:
  - Shows real API error message (already surfaced from the server)
  - "Try Again" button — calls `handleChallengeFriends()` directly (function already clears error state at top)
  - "Start Fresh →" link to `/play` — exits the flow cleanly
  - Dev-only note (guarded by `process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"`): "Local dev: if you recently reset the DB, try a fresh incognito window or restart pnpm dev."
- When no error: normal "Challenge Friends →" button is shown (unchanged behavior)
- TypeScript: clean

### Ranked voting clipboard fixes (carried over from previous session)
- `WritingView.handleShareChallenge` — replaced raw `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with `copyToClipboard` helper; added `shareCopyFailed` state; fallback message shown below button
- `ChallengeLiveView.handleShareLink` — same fix
- `RevealView` — fixed missing `copyFailed` prop in destructure (TypeScript was catching `copyFailed` as undeclared)

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean.

**What was made recoverable:**
- Failed Challenge Friends API call no longer leaves the user stuck on a red message with no escape
- Server errors in development now surface the real cause instead of "Internal server error"
- DB connection failures get their own message instead of a generic 500

**What we are intentionally not over-optimizing:**
- Stale `rhyzzle_participant` cookies: these are `httpOnly` (JS can't clear them), and they already degrade gracefully — GET room returns `currentParticipantId: null` → user sees join form. No crash.
- Challenge Friends retry doesn't clear the name input — intentional, user typed it once.
- No deep Prisma error class imports — we check `(err as any).code` string, which covers the real-world failure cases without extra deps.

---

## Session 11 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Replace the state-machine voting model for Challenge Links with a "live all day, locks at 9 PM" timing model.

**Key product correction:** Challenge Links should never require a manual "Start Voting" step. Submissions and voting are open from room creation until `locksAt`. Votes can be changed before lock. Final results appear automatically after lock.

**What was done:**

### `lib/utils.ts`
- Added `getDefaultLocksAt()` — returns next 9 PM as ISO timestamp. If 9 PM has already passed today, returns tomorrow 9 PM. Uses Node.js process timezone (set `TZ` env var for consistent server behavior).

### `lib/types.ts`
- Added `locksAt: string | null` to `RoomStateDTO` — ISO timestamp stored at creation; null for GROUP_ROOM.
- Added `isLocked: boolean` — always `false` in stored state; GET recomputes dynamically from `locksAt`.
- Added `currentParticipantVotedForId: string | null` — which submissionId this participant voted for; null in stored state; GET computes per-requester. Enables vote-change UI.

### `lib/room-store.ts`
- Added `getVoteForParticipant(roomCode, participantId)` — returns the participant's current vote (for `currentParticipantVotedForId`).

### `app/api/rooms/route.ts`
- For CHALLENGE_LINK: imports and calls `getDefaultLocksAt()`, stores as `locksAt` in room state.
- Initializes `isLocked: false` and `currentParticipantVotedForId: null` in stored state.

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/route.ts` (GET)
- Computes `isLocked = Date.now() >= new Date(locksAt)` for CHALLENGE_LINK rooms.
- Computes `currentParticipantVotedForId` from vote store.
- For CHALLENGE_LINK: always builds `submissions` (regardless of room status), anonymous before lock, named + vote counts after lock, winner marked after lock.
- GROUP_ROOM submission building unchanged (VOTING/REVEAL states).

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/submit/route.ts`
- For CHALLENGE_LINK: checks `isLocked` instead of `status === "WRITING"`. Error: "Today's Rhyzzle is locked. Final results are live."
- For GROUP_ROOM: unchanged (status check preserved).

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/vote/route.ts`
- For CHALLENGE_LINK: checks `isLocked`; removes double-vote 409 (votes can be changed — `saveVote` overwrites same key).
- For GROUP_ROOM: unchanged (status check + double-vote prevention preserved).

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/start-voting/route.ts`
- For CHALLENGE_LINK: returns graceful 200 message "Challenge Links are live all day."
- For GROUP_ROOM: host-only state transition preserved.

### `app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx`
- Added `formatLockTime(locksAt)` helper — formats ISO timestamp to "9 PM" / "8:30 PM" in browser local time.
- Added `currentParticipantVotedForId` hydration effect — initializes `selectedSubmissionId` on page load from server.
- Main render: CHALLENGE_LINK rooms route to `ChallengeLinkView`; GROUP_ROOM uses existing state machine.
- **Removed:** `WritingJoinView`, `VotingLateJoinView` (replaced by new components).
- **Simplified:** `LateArrivalView` — now GROUP_ROOM only, no `roomMode` prop.
- **New:** `ChallengeLinkView` — wrapper routing `isLocked → ChallengeFinalView`, `!hasJoined → ChallengeLinkJoinView`, `!hasSubmitted → writing board`, `hasSubmitted → ChallengeLiveView`.
- **New:** `ChallengeLinkJoinView` — "Submit and vote before 9 PM" join form.
- **New:** `ChallengeLiveView` — post-submit view: live status card, anonymous voting cards, "Cast Vote" / "Change Vote →", "Votes can change until results lock" note, share card.
- **New:** `ChallengeFinalView` — final results after lock: winner, ranked submissions with names + vote counts, "Play Today's Rhyzzle →", "Start New Challenge" CTAs.
- Nav badge: "Live" (green pulse) / "Locked" (grey) for CHALLENGE_LINK; existing status badge for GROUP_ROOM.

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean, no errors.

**Status after this session:**
Challenge Links are now live all day. Creator sends link → friends join any time → write bars any time → vote any time → vote can be changed before 9 PM → final results show automatically after lock. No "Start Voting" button. No host dependency. Group Rooms are completely unchanged.

**Next 5 tasks:**
1. End-to-end QA: solo play → challenge friends → friend joins → both write → vote + change vote → verify final results after lock
2. Connect PostgreSQL: `.env.local` → `pnpm db:push` → replace in-memory store with Prisma
3. Make BeatPlayer functional with real audio file
4. Persist solo daily entries server-side (bars currently lost on navigate before Challenge Friends)
5. Test GROUP_ROOM flow end-to-end to verify state machine still works

---

## Session 10 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Remove host dependency for Challenge Link rooms. Any submitted participant can start voting once 2+ submissions exist.

**What was done:**

### `lib/types.ts`
- Added `RoomMode = "CHALLENGE_LINK" | "GROUP_ROOM"` type
- Added `roomMode: RoomMode` field to `RoomStateDTO` — stored at creation, returned by GET

### `app/api/rooms/route.ts`
- Sets `roomMode: "CHALLENGE_LINK"` when `source === "CHALLENGE_LINK"`, `roomMode: "GROUP_ROOM"` otherwise

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/start-voting/route.ts`
- Rewritten authorization: reads `room.roomMode`
- `CHALLENGE_LINK`: any joined participant who has submitted can start voting (403 if not submitted)
- `GROUP_ROOM`: host-only (existing behavior preserved)
- Both: require ≥ 2 submissions and WRITING state

### `app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx`
- `WritingView` receives two new props: `roomMode` and `roomCode`
- `canStartVoting` now computed per room mode: challenge = any submitted participant at 2+; group = host only at 2+
- **Waiting state — Challenge Link:**
  - When `submittedCount < 2`: shows share card with room URL, "Send to Group Chat" button, copy text "Think you can beat me?"
  - When `submittedCount >= 2`: shows "Vote who cooked" prompt + "Start Voting →" button (to any submitted participant)
- **Waiting state — Group Room:** unchanged (host-only "Start Voting →" at 2+ submissions)
- `WritingJoinView` shows "challenged you" copy with beat info and "Write Your Bars →" CTA

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean.

**Status after this session:**
Challenge link rooms no longer depend on the creator staying active. Once a friend submits, either the creator or the friend can tap "Start Voting →". Group room host-only behavior is unchanged.

**Next 5 tasks:**
1. Connect PostgreSQL: `.env.local` → `pnpm db:push` → replace in-memory store
2. Make BeatPlayer functional with a real audio file
3. End-to-end QA: solo play → challenge friends → second window joins → both submit → friend starts voting → reveal
4. Persist solo daily entries (so bars survive navigation before Challenge Friends)
5. Voting reveal: show submitted participant names correctly in REVEAL state for challenge links

---

## Session 9 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Implement the Daily Play → Challenge Friends flow. Users write solo first, then optionally challenge friends. Remove the "create room before writing" friction from the primary path.

**What was done:**

### `lib/daily-challenge.ts`
- Added `variantToChallengeDTO(variant)` — converts `DailyChallengeVariant` → `ChallengeDTO` (the shape used by `LyricPuzzleCanvas` and the room store). Used by both the solo daily play page and the API.

### `lib/types.ts`
- `CreateRoomRequest.source` — added `"CHALLENGE_LINK"` as a valid value (alongside `"DAILY_CHALLENGE"`)
- `CreateRoomRequest.submittedBars?: string[]` — new field: creator's already-written bars, saved as their first submission when a CHALLENGE_LINK room is created

### `app/api/rooms/route.ts`
- `source: "CHALLENGE_LINK"` path: creates room with `status: "WRITING"` (skips LOBBY), marks host as `hasSubmitted: true`, sets `submittedCount: 1`, and immediately calls `saveSubmission()` with the creator's bars. Challenge link rooms start ready for friends to join and write.
- `source: "DAILY_CHALLENGE"` path: unchanged — creates room in LOBBY state
- Legacy `beatId`/`challengeId` path: unchanged

### `app/play/page.tsx`
- Mode cards (3/6/8) now link to `/play/N` instead of `/create?barCount=N`

### `app/play/[barCount]/page.tsx` — **new file**
- Solo daily writing experience. No account or room required.
- Validates `barCount` param (must be 3, 6, or 8)
- Uses `getDailyVariant(barCount)` + `variantToChallengeDTO()` to build the `ChallengeDTO`
- Shows `BeatPlayer` (today's beat) + `LyricPuzzleCanvas` (full puzzle board with rule chips)
- Sticky "Submit Bars 🔥" button — disabled until all bars are filled
- On submit: transitions to post-submit screen (no API call for solo play)
- **Post-submit screen:**
  - Shows submitted bars preview
  - Name input field (required for Challenge Friends)
  - **Primary CTA:** "Challenge Friends →" — POSTs `source: "CHALLENGE_LINK"` to API, redirects to `/room/[roomCode]`
  - **Secondary:** "Copy Result" — copies bars + share link to clipboard
  - **Secondary:** "Start Group Room" — links to `/create?barCount=N`
  - **Secondary:** "← Back Home"

### `app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx`
- **WRITING + not-joined gate (new):** When `status === "WRITING"` and `!hasJoined`, renders `WritingJoinView` instead of `WritingView`. Enables friends to join a challenge link room directly in WRITING state.
- **`WritingJoinView` (new component):** Shows challenger's name ("Grayson challenged you"), beat info, name input, "Write Your Bars →" CTA. Falls back to generic copy if no host name.
- **`GuestJoinView` props updated:** `challengeTitle` → `barCount` (more useful display). Shows host's name when available.
- **`handleShare` updated:** Share text now reads "Grayson finished today's Rhyzzle. Think you can beat them?" — challenge framing, not room management.
- **LobbyView share button:** "Send to Group Chat" (was "Invite friends — tap to copy link")
- **CLOSED state + RevealView CTAs:** Now link to `/play` ("Play Today's Rhyzzle" / "Play Again →") instead of `/create`
- **barLines init `useEffect`:** Now requires `hasJoined` to prevent initializing the writing state for un-joined friends

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean, no errors.
**Routes:** All three routes (/, /play, /play/6) return 200.

**Status after this session:**
Full daily-first flow is working. User can go Home → Play Today → pick 3/6/8 → write bars solo → submit → challenge friends (creates CHALLENGE_LINK room, submits their bars immediately) → friends open link → join with name → write bars → host starts voting → reveal. Start Group Room still works as a secondary path from both Home and the post-submit screen.

**Next 5 tasks:**
1. Connect PostgreSQL: `.env.local` → `pnpm db:push` → `pnpm db:seed`
2. Replace in-memory stores with Prisma (rooms, submissions, votes)
3. Make BeatPlayer functional with real audio
4. End-to-end QA: solo play → challenge friends → 2+ friends join → write → vote → reveal
5. CLOSED state / "Play Again" flow

---

## Session 8 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Make rule chips in the puzzle board interactive — tapping opens a help sheet with definition, example, and tip.

**What was done:**

- `lib/rule-help.ts` — **new file.** Centralized rule education map. `RuleHelpKey` union type (13 keys). `RuleHelp` interface with `label`, `chipClass`, `textClass`, `shortDefinition`, `example`, `tip`. `RULE_HELP` record with full definitions for: SETUP_RHYME, END_RHYME, RHYME_WITH_LINE, INTERNAL_RHYME, CHAIN_RHYME, METAPHOR, THEME_REFERENCE, PUNCHLINE, CALLBACK, ALLITERATION, ASSONANCE, REQUIRED_WORD, WRITE.

- `components/rule-help-sheet.tsx` — **new component.** Fixed bottom sheet. Backdrop (tap to dismiss) + white panel with drag handle, colored badge, definition, example block, 💡 tip, "Got it" button. Closes on Escape key. No external dependencies.

- `components/lyric-puzzle-canvas.tsx` — updated:
  - `ChipData` interface: added `helpKey: RuleHelpKey`
  - `ruleToChip()`: added `helpKey` for all 10 explicit ConstraintType cases
  - `buildMeta()`: added `helpKey` to all three chip paths (explicit rule, inferred rhyme, SETUP RHYME)
  - Added `useState<RuleHelpKey | null>` for `activeHelpKey`
  - Added `openHelp(helpKey, e)` — calls `e.preventDefault()` + `e.stopPropagation()`, sets active key
  - Rule chips changed from `<span>` to `<button type="button">` with `active:scale-95` and `?` suffix
  - Required word chips changed from `<span>` to `<button>` that opens `REQUIRED_WORD` help
  - `RuleHelpSheet` rendered at bottom of component, bound to `activeHelpKey`

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean.
**Build:** `pnpm next build` — clean. `/room/[roomCode]` page = 11.5 kB (rule content included in bundle).

**Status after this session:**
Every rule chip in the writing canvas is now tappable. Tapping opens a bottom sheet explaining the rule with a plain-English definition, example, and quick tip. Works on mobile and desktop. Dismiss by tapping the backdrop, pressing Escape, or hitting "Got it".

**Next 5 tasks:**
1. Connect PostgreSQL: `.env.local` → `pnpm db:push` → `pnpm db:seed`
2. Replace in-memory stores with real Prisma operations
3. Make BeatPlayer functional with real audio
4. End-to-end integration test (create → join → write → vote → reveal)
5. Daily challenge page (Phase 3)

---

## Session 7 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Complete the full private room game loop: WRITING → VOTING → REVEAL.

**What was done:**

### `lib/room-store.ts`
- Added `StoredVote` interface (`voteId`, `participantId`, `submissionId`, `roomCode`, `votedAt`)
- Added `global.__rhyzzleVotes` Map (survives HMR, same pattern as rooms/submissions)
- Added exports: `saveVote`, `hasParticipantVoted`, `getVotesForRoom`, `getVoteCountsForRoom`

### `lib/types.ts`
- `SubmissionDTO`: added `isOwnSubmission?: boolean` (server-computed per-requester), comments on anonymization
- `RoomStateDTO`: added `currentParticipantHasVoted: boolean` and `votedCount: number`

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/route.ts` — GET fully updated
- Reads `rhyzzle_participant` cookie to compute `currentParticipantHasVoted`
- Computes `votedCount` from voteStore on every GET (live count, no caching)
- In VOTING state: builds anonymous `SubmissionDTO[]` — `participantId: ""`, `nickname: null`, `voteCount: 0`, `isOwnSubmission` set per-requester
- In REVEAL state: builds full `SubmissionDTO[]` — real `participantId`, real `nickname`, real `voteCount`, `isWinner: true` for max-vote holders

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/start-voting/route.ts` — new
- POST, host-only (403 non-host), idempotent check (WRITING only), needs ≥2 submissions (400 otherwise)
- Transitions room to VOTING via `updateRoom`

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/vote/route.ts` — rewritten from stub
- Full implementation: room must be VOTING, participant must be in room, no double-vote (409), no self-vote (400), submission must exist in room (404)
- Saves vote with `saveVote`

### `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/reveal/route.ts` — new
- POST, host-only (403 non-host), room must be VOTING, needs ≥1 vote (400 otherwise)
- Transitions room to REVEAL via `updateRoom`

### `app/api/rooms/route.ts`
- Added `currentParticipantHasVoted: false` and `votedCount: 0` to initial room state (satisfies TypeScript)

### `app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx` — updated throughout
- Added `isStartingVoting`, `isRevealing` state
- Added `handleStartVoting()`, `handleReveal()` async functions
- Added `hasVoted` hydration effect from `roomState.currentParticipantHasVoted`
- `WritingView` waiting state: host sees "Start Voting →" button when ≥2 submissions; guests see waiting message; both see submission progress bar
- `VotingView`: full rewrite — anonymous card per submission (labeled A/B/C), own submission card disabled with "Your submission" label, selected card highlighted amber, blue gradient "Cast Vote" button, host sees "Reveal Winner 👑" button in a host controls panel (requires ≥1 vote), voted state shows waiting screen
- `RevealView`: full rewrite — winner shown in amber card, tied winners all shown, runner-ups listed with vote counts, "Share Results" + "Create New Room" action buttons, tie handling ("It's a tie!")

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean, no errors.
**Build:** `pnpm next build` — clean. 4 new API routes visible in route table.

**Status after this session:**
Full game loop is complete. Host creates room → players join → host starts writing → players write bars → host starts voting → players vote anonymously → host reveals winner → reveal screen shows winner and all submissions with names. Refresh preserves all state (submitted, voted). Ties are handled. All validations enforced.

**Next 5 tasks:**
1. Connect PostgreSQL: `.env.local` → `pnpm db:push` → `pnpm db:seed`
2. Replace in-memory stores with real Prisma operations
3. Make BeatPlayer functional (real audio playback from beat URLs)
4. End-to-end integration test (create → 2+ users join → write → vote → reveal)
5. CLOSED state / "Play Again" flow

---

## Session 6 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Replace the single-textarea lyric canvas with a per-line puzzle board (Genius-inspired) that shows the full rhyme map before the user types anything.

**What was done:**

- `components/lyric-puzzle-canvas.tsx` — **new component.** Full puzzle board:
  - Color palette: 8 named colors (yellow, cyan, green, purple, pink, amber, orange, zinc), each with chip/text/row/gutter variants
  - Scheme letter → color mapping (A=yellow, B=purple, C=cyan, D=pink, E=green, F=orange, X=zinc)
  - Rule → chip data: `ruleToChip()` maps all ConstraintType values to label + color + placeholder
  - Rhyme scheme derivation: `deriveScheme()` — (1) explicit RHYME_SCHEME rule string → (2) infer from END_RHYME lineIndex/targetLine pairs → (3) default couplet AABBCCDD
  - Per-line metadata: `buildMeta()` — priority system (PUNCHLINE=10 → REQUIRED_WORD=1) picks best explicit rule per line; fallback to inferred rhyme chip or SETUP RHYME chip
  - Renders: scheme summary pills row → required words row → white canvas card
  - Each canvas row: colored gutter (44px, line number + scheme letter badge) + content area (rule chip + rhyme connector label + transparent `<input type="text">`)
  - Row tint: colored when empty, fades to white when user types (live)
  - Enter key advances focus to next input; Backspace on empty returns to previous
  - Footer: progress dots + "X / N bars" count

- `app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx` — **WritingView wired to puzzle canvas:**
  - Imports: removed `LyricCanvasEditor`, `HighlightLegend`, `ChallengeCard`; added `LyricPuzzleCanvas`
  - State: `lyricsText: string` → `barLines: string[]`
  - New `useEffect`: initializes `barLines` to `Array(barCount).fill("")` when room enters WRITING and array is empty
  - New `handleBarLineChange(index, value)` — immutable update helper
  - `handleSubmit`: now reads from `barLines` instead of splitting a textarea string
  - `WritingView` props: `lyricsText`/`setLyricsText` → `barLines`/`onLineChange`
  - `WritingView` body: replaced `ChallengeCard` + required word strip + `LyricCanvasEditor` + `HighlightLegend` with single `LyricPuzzleCanvas`; validation now checks `barLines.every(l => l.trim())`; loading guard while `barLines.length < barCount`

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean, no errors.
**Build:** `pnpm next build` — compiles cleanly, `/room/[roomCode]` page = 8.08 kB.

**Status after this session:**
WRITING state now shows the full colorful puzzle board immediately on load. Each bar line displays its scheme letter, rule chip, and placeholder before the user types. Row tints fade as bars are filled. Submit flow unchanged — still POSTs `{ lines: string[] }` to the existing API.

**Next 5 tasks:**
1. VOTING state — host "End Writing" button (WRITING→VOTING), anonymous submission display, one vote per participant
2. `POST /api/rooms/[roomCode]/vote` — store vote, prevent double-voting
3. REVEAL state — sorted by votes, names revealed, share card
4. Connect PostgreSQL: `.env.local` → `pnpm db:push` → `pnpm db:seed`
5. Replace in-memory store with real Prisma operations

---

## Session 5 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Redesign the WRITING state UI to feel like a premium mobile rap puzzle game.

**What was done:**

- `components/lyric-canvas-editor.tsx` — **new component.** Single `<textarea>` with a left line-number gutter. Both use `line-height: 1.75rem` and matching vertical padding so gutter numbers align to textarea rows. Progress dots footer (filled = bar written). Real-time bar count validation (`N / barCount`). Turns green border when valid, shows amber note when too few/many bars.
- `components/highlight-legend.tsx` — **new component.** Color guide card showing dot or dashed-underline indicator for each future highlight category (setup rhyme, internal rhyme, metaphor, punchline, callback, required word, needs fixing). Labeled "coming soon" since AI analysis isn't wired yet.
- `components/beat-player.tsx` — **complete visual redesign.** Dark gradient card with violet artwork placeholder, BPM + genre + LOOP badges, fake waveform (32 bars that fill violet as the track plays), invisible `<input type=range>` overlay for seeking, time display. All audio logic (play/pause, timeupdate, seek) preserved unchanged.
- `components/challenge-card.tsx` — **complete visual redesign.** Each rule now has a colored numbered circular badge (yellow = end rhyme, cyan = internal rhyme, green = metaphor, purple = punchline, pink = callback, amber = required word, etc.) matching the future highlight color system. Required words shown as amber caps chips.
- `app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx` — **WritingView redesigned end-to-end:**
  - State: `bars: string[]` → `lyricsText: string` (single string, split on submit)
  - `handleSubmit`: splits `lyricsText` by `\n`, trims, filters empty lines → sends `{ lines }` array to the existing submit API (no API change)
  - `WritingView`: phased header with pulsing amber dot, `BeatPlayer`, `ChallengeCard`, optional required word strip, `LyricCanvasEditor`, `HighlightLegend`, fixed sticky submit button with violet gradient and gradient fade background
  - Submit button disabled until `nonEmptyCount === barCount`; validation note shown inline above button
  - Submitted/waiting card redesigned: progress bar, beat player stays visible while waiting
  - `fetchRoom` deps cleaned up (removed stale `bars.length` dep)
- `DECISIONS.md` — documented lyric canvas design choice

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean, no errors.
**Build:** `pnpm next build` — compiles cleanly, `/room/[roomCode]` page = 7.25 kB.

**Status after this session:**
WRITING state looks and feels like a premium mobile game. Lyric canvas replaces individual input boxes. All existing game flow (LOBBY → WRITING → SUBMIT → WAITING, refresh persistence, host/guest behavior) is preserved.

**Next 5 tasks:**
1. VOTING state — host "End Writing" button (WRITING → VOTING), show anonymous submissions, one vote per participant
2. `POST /api/rooms/[roomCode]/vote` — store vote in submission store, prevent double-voting
3. REVEAL state — sort by votes, show winner, de-anonymize names
4. Connect PostgreSQL: `.env.local` → `pnpm db:push` → `pnpm db:seed`
5. Replace in-memory store with real Prisma operations

---

## Session 4 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Build LOBBY → WRITING → SUBMIT BARS → WAITING slice.

**What was done:**

- `lib/types.ts` — added `currentParticipantHasSubmitted: boolean` to `RoomStateDTO`
- `lib/room-store.ts` — added `StoredSubmission` interface and submission store (second global `Map`, keyed by `ROOMCODE:participantId`); added `saveSubmission`, `getSubmission`, `hasParticipantSubmitted`, `getSubmissionsForRoom` exports
- `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/start/route.ts` — new route; POST, host-only; 403 for non-host; 404 for unknown room; idempotent if already started; advances LOBBY → WRITING via `updateRoom`
- `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/submit/route.ts` — fully implemented; validates room status (must be WRITING), deduplicates (409 on second attempt), saves to submission store, marks `hasSubmitted: true` on participant, increments `submittedCount`
- `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/route.ts` — GET now returns `currentParticipantHasSubmitted` by querying submission store
- `app/api/rooms/route.ts` — added `currentParticipantHasSubmitted: false` to initial room state to satisfy TypeScript
- `app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx`:
  - Added `isStarting` state and `handleStart()` — POSTs to `/start`, then refreshes room
  - Added `useEffect` that hydrates `hasSubmitted` from `roomState.currentParticipantHasSubmitted` — refresh-safe
  - Replaced host controls placeholder in `LobbyView` with real green "Start Game →" button
  - `LobbyView` now accepts `onStart` + `isStarting` props

**Verified at API level:**
- `POST /api/rooms/CODE/start` → `{ status: "WRITING" }`, room advances
- `POST /api/rooms/CODE/start` (non-host) → 403
- `POST /api/rooms/CODE/start` (already WRITING) → idempotent `{ status: "WRITING" }`
- `POST /api/rooms/CODE/submit` → `{ submissionId }`, `submittedCount` increments
- `GET /api/rooms/CODE` after submit → `currentParticipantHasSubmitted: true`
- `POST /api/rooms/CODE/submit` (duplicate) → 409

**Status after this session:**
Full LOBBY → WRITING → SUBMIT → WAITING flow is functional. Submitted state survives page refresh. Host sees "Start Game →" button; guests see "Waiting for host to start." TypeScript passes clean.

**Next 5 tasks:**
1. Implement VOTING state — host "End Writing" button (WRITING → VOTING), show anonymous submissions, one vote per participant
2. Implement `POST /api/rooms/[roomCode]/vote` — store vote, prevent double-voting
3. Implement REVEAL state — sort by votes, show winner, de-anonymize names
4. Connect PostgreSQL: `.env.local` → `pnpm db:push` → `pnpm db:seed`
5. Replace in-memory store with real Prisma operations

---

## Session 2 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Fix "Room not found" bug — make create → room flow work end to end.

**Root cause diagnosed:**
- `POST /api/rooms` was generating a room code but never persisting anything (placeholder stub).
- `GET /api/rooms/[roomCode]` was hardcoded to only recognize `"TEST1"`. Any other code returned 404.
- No database connected (`.env.local` missing), so DB operations weren't possible yet.

**What was done:**

- Created `lib/room-store.ts` — in-memory global Map as a dev bridge. Rooms persist across requests for the lifetime of the dev server process. Clearly labeled as dev-only; to be replaced with Prisma calls once DB is set up.
- Rewrote `app/api/rooms/route.ts` — validates beat/challenge IDs, generates unique code, builds full `RoomStateDTO`, saves to store, returns `{ roomCode, roomId }`.
- Rewrote `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/route.ts` — looks up room code in store (uppercased), returns 404 only for truly unknown codes.
- Rewrote `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/join/route.ts` — looks up room, adds participant to store, sets session + participant cookies.
- Updated `DECISIONS.md` — documented in-memory store decision and canonical `roomCode` field.
- Updated `TASKS.md` — marked 6 Phase 1 tasks as DONE.

**Verified working:**
- `POST /api/rooms` → `{ roomCode: "WS9VA", roomId: "room_WS9VA" }`
- `GET /api/rooms/WS9VA` → full room JSON (200)
- `GET /api/rooms/FAKEX` → 404

**Status after this session:**
Create → redirect → room page loads the correct room. LOBBY state visible. Participants can join. Full flow unblocked without requiring a database.

**Next 5 tasks:**
1. Connect PostgreSQL: copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`, fill `DATABASE_URL`, run `pnpm db:push && pnpm db:seed`
2. Replace room-store calls with real Prisma operations in all three API routes
3. Implement WRITING state — host advances room, bar editor + beat player active
4. Implement `POST /api/rooms/[roomCode]/submit` — save bars to store/DB
5. Implement VOTING state — anonymous submissions, vote button

---

## Session 3 — 2026-06-01

**Goal:** Fix create-room UX — host should land directly in the room lobby, not see a join form.

**Root cause diagnosed:**
- `/create` had no nickname field — host had no identity
- `POST /api/rooms` never created a host participant and never set session cookies
- `GET /api/rooms/[roomCode]` never read cookies, so `currentParticipantId` was always null
- Room page's `hasJoined` state started `false` on every load — every visitor (including the host) saw the join form

**What was done:**

- `lib/types.ts` — added `hostNickname: string` to `CreateRoomRequest`; added `hostParticipantId` to `CreateRoomResponse`; added `currentParticipantId: string | null` to `RoomStateDTO`
- `app/api/rooms/route.ts` — accepts `hostNickname`; creates host `RoomParticipant` (isHost: true) as the first participant; sets `rhyzzle_session` + `rhyzzle_participant` cookies on the create response
- `app/api/rooms/[roomCode]/route.ts` — reads `rhyzzle_participant` cookie from request; finds matching participant in room; returns `currentParticipantId` and `isHost` per-requester (not stored in room state)
- `app/create/page.tsx` — added "Your Name" input field (required, autofocused); sends `hostNickname` in POST body; button disabled until name is entered; summary card shows host name
- `app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx` — added `useEffect` that watches `roomState.currentParticipantId` and auto-sets `hasJoined=true` when non-null; split `LobbyJoinView` into `GuestJoinView` (for newcomers) and `LobbyView` (for everyone already in the room); `LobbyView` shows beat/challenge summary + share button + participant list

**Verified at API level:**
- `POST /api/rooms` → `{ roomCode, roomId, hostParticipantId }` + sets cookies
- `GET /api/rooms/YVGZA` with host cookie → `currentParticipantId: "p_YVGZA_host"`, `isHost: true`
- `GET /api/rooms/YVGZA` without cookie → `currentParticipantId: null`, `isHost: false`
- After guest joins → 2 participants, guest GET returns their own `currentParticipantId`

**Status after this session:**
Full create → room lobby flow works correctly. Host lands directly in lobby with their name, the share link, and the game summary. Guests see the join form. Refresh doesn't duplicate participants.

**Next 5 tasks:**
1. Add "Start Game" button for host → advances room from LOBBY → WRITING
2. Implement `POST /api/rooms/[roomCode]/submit` — save bars to store, track submitted count
3. Implement WRITING state fully — beat player + challenge card + bar editor functional
4. Implement VOTING state — anonymous submissions displayed, one vote per participant
5. Implement REVEAL state — show winner, de-anonymize names

---

## Session 19 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Multi-condition rule chips per line, SIMILE category, highlight color legend, metaphor/simile distinction, live detected-phrase display.

**What was done:**

### Foundation types
- `lib/types.ts` — added `"SIMILE"` to `HighlightCategory` union
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — added `SIMILE` to `HighlightCategory` enum; ran `pnpm prisma generate`
- `lib/utils.ts` — added SIMILE entries to `HIGHLIGHT_COLORS` (dark bg: teal-500/20) and `HIGHLIGHT_COLORS_LIGHT` (teal-100)
- `lib/rule-checks/types.ts` — added `SIMILE: "teal"` to `CATEGORY_COLOR`

### Metaphor/simile fix
- `lib/rule-checks/ai-placeholder.ts` — `checkMetaphor` now emits `category: "SIMILE"` for simile patterns ("like a/an/the", "feel like", etc.) and `category: "METAPHOR"` for true metaphor patterns. "So open like a window" correctly gets SIMILE, not METAPHOR.

### Multi-chip system
- `lib/lyric-meta.ts` — new `LineChip` interface and `getLineAllChips(lineIndex, challenge, scheme)` function. Returns primary chip (highest-priority explicit rule) + optional secondary chips. Adds secondary RHYME ↔ Ln chip when the line has a rhyme relationship that isn't already covered by an explicit rhyme rule.
- `components/lyric-puzzle-canvas.tsx` — computes `getLineAllChips()` per line; renders all chips as buttons (primary: text-[10px], secondary: text-[9px] opacity-80); removed old `↔ line N` text span (now inside secondary chip label)
- `components/submission-pattern-card.tsx` — renders all chips per row (primary full-size, secondary text-[8px] opacity-75); no status indicators (inline highlights are the evidence)

### Live metaphor/simile distinction
- `lib/rule-checks/live-checks.ts` — added `detectedPhrase: string | null` to `LineHint`; metaphor case now checks `highlights[0].category === "SIMILE"` and shows "Simile detected ~" vs "Metaphor detected ✓"; `detectedPhrase` set from first highlight's text
- `components/lyric-puzzle-canvas.tsx` — shows detected phrase pill below input when `hint.detectedPhrase` is set (teal-50 styling)

### Highlight legend
- New `components/highlight-key.tsx` — compact 8-entry color legend with copy: "Row colors show the assignment. Highlights show what Rhyzzle detected."
- `app/play/[barCount]/page.tsx` — `<HighlightKey />` rendered below `SubmissionPatternCard` in post-submit screen

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean.

**Status after this session:**
Multi-chip display live across canvas and result cards. SIMILE/METAPHOR correctly distinguished at both the heuristic detection and highlight level. "like a window" → SIMILE chip + teal highlight. Detected phrase shown while typing. Highlight legend on post-submit screen. All pushed to origin/main.

## Session 20 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Live inline highlights in the writing canvas while typing.

**Approach chosen: Option A — Overlay text highlighter**

Each input row gets an absolutely-positioned `<div>` overlay that renders the full text with colored background spans (no horizontal padding, so character positions stay aligned). The `<input>` uses `color: transparent` + `caretColor` when spans are detected. Scroll is synced via `overlay.scrollLeft = input.scrollLeft` on `onChange` / `onScroll` / `onFocus` via `requestAnimationFrame`.

**New file — `lib/rule-checks/live-highlights.ts`:**
- `getLiveHighlightSpans(lines, challenge): ComputedHighlightSpan[][]` — one span array per line
- Required words: amber highlight, appears immediately on whole-word match
- End rhymes: blue highlight on end word once partner line has text (high opacity exact, soft opacity slant)
- Alliteration: orange on each detected word (only for lines with ALLITERATION rule)
- Metaphor/simile: green/teal phrase span (only for lines with METAPHOR rule)
- Theme reference: green when theme word found
- Punchline/callback: no spans (subjective — "→ submit" still shown)

**Modified — `components/lyric-puzzle-canvas.tsx`:**
- New `LiveHighlightText` component (local) — renders text with inline `backgroundColor` spans, no padding
- `overlayRefs` array parallel to `inputRefs`
- `CARET_COLOR` map: hex values matching `col.textDark` Tailwind palette
- `LIVE_HL_RGB`: per-category RGB base colors, alpha varies by confidence (0.78 strong / 0.45 soft)
- `liveSpans` state initialized from `getLiveHighlightSpans`, debounced 300ms with `liveState`
- `hasSpans = lineSpans.length > 0 && !disabled` — controls overlay visibility and input transparency
- Guidance note: "Live highlights are draft hints. Final checks run on submit."

**Typing safety:**
- Overlay is `pointer-events: none` — all taps/clicks go through to the input
- Input is `z-index: 10` (relative), overlay is `position: absolute`
- `color: transparent` only applied when spans exist (empty lines show text normally)
- `requestAnimationFrame` for scroll sync avoids blocking the change handler
- Disabled mode: `hasSpans = false` — overlay never shown, input normal

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean.

**Known limitations:**
- Very long bars (60+ chars on narrow screens) may show highlight misalignment past the overflow point; scroll sync mitigates this
- Slant rhyme highlights use soft opacity (0.45) and only appear after partner line has text
- Subjective rules (punchline, callback, internal rhyme, assonance) still show "→ submit" — no overlay spans

## Session 21 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Live Rhyzzle Checklist — compact summary of puzzle completion while typing.

**What was done:**

### `lib/rule-checks/checklist.ts` (new)
- `buildChecklist(lines, challenge): ChecklistState` — pure function, no AI, no Node APIs
- `ChecklistStatus` union: `"COMPLETE" | "NEEDS_REVIEW" | "MISSING" | "CHECK_AFTER_SUBMIT"`
- `ChecklistItem` has `id`, `label`, `detail?`, `status`, `relatedLines?`, `wordChips?`
- Item types generated:
  1. **Bars** — `filledCount / barCount`, COMPLETE when all filled
  2. **Required words** — one item with `wordChips[]`, each chip found/missing; overall COMPLETE/NEEDS_REVIEW/MISSING
  3. **Rhyme groups** — one per unique scheme letter (2+ lines); checks all pairs via `checkEndRhymePair`; COMPLETE for exact rhyme, NEEDS_REVIEW for slant, MISSING if partner not written
  4. **Per-line explicit rules** — highest-priority non-scheme rule per line:
     - PUNCHLINE/CALLBACK/ASSONANCE/INTERNAL_RHYME → CHECK_AFTER_SUBMIT
     - ALLITERATION → deterministic COMPLETE or NEEDS_REVIEW
     - METAPHOR → COMPLETE (metaphor), NEEDS_REVIEW (simile detected), CHECK_AFTER_SUBMIT (not detected)
     - THEME_REFERENCE → COMPLETE or NEEDS_REVIEW
     - CHAIN_RHYME → COMPLETE or NEEDS_REVIEW
- `ChecklistState` includes counts for all 4 statuses

### `components/rhyzzle-checklist.tsx` (new)
- Starts **collapsed** — header shows `N / M` badge + inline `X~ Y missing` counts
- Tap header to expand full item list
- Each row: icon (✓/~/✗/→) + colored label + detail text
- Required words item: renders word chips (green=found, red=missing)
- 300ms debounce via `useEffect` — same cadence as live highlights
- Footer: "Hints only — humans still vote who cooked."

### `app/play/[barCount]/page.tsx`
- Added `<RhyzzleChecklist lines={barLines} challenge={challenge} />` below the canvas in scrollable writing area

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean.

**Status after this session:**
Live checklist shipped. Shows bar count, required word chips, rhyme group pass/slant/missing, per-line rule status, and after-submit indicators. Collapsed by default with count summary. All pushed to origin/main.

---

## Session 22 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Wire `RhyzzleChecklist` into the room writing experience so both GROUP_ROOM and CHALLENGE_LINK participants see the live checklist while typing bars.

**What was done:**

### `app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx`
- Added `import { RhyzzleChecklist } from "@/components/rhyzzle-checklist"`
- **`WritingView`** (GROUP_ROOM writing phase, lines ~785–797): added `<RhyzzleChecklist lines={barLines} challenge={challenge} />` below the `LyricPuzzleCanvas`, inside the `space-y-4` scrollable area. Guarded by `barLines.length === barCount` (same guard as the canvas) so it never renders with a mismatched array.
- **`ChallengeLinkView`** (CHALLENGE_LINK writing phase, lines ~1143–1155): same treatment — checklist placed after canvas in scrollable area, same guard.

**No new components, no new helpers** — reuses `rhyzzle-checklist.tsx` and `lib/rule-checks/checklist.ts` unchanged.

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean, zero errors.

**Status after this session:**
Checklist is now live in all three writing contexts: solo `/play/[barCount]`, GROUP_ROOM writing phase, and CHALLENGE_LINK writing phase. Updates on every keystroke (300ms debounce). Does not block submit. Does not affect live highlights, voting, or reveal.

## Session 23 — 2026-06-02

**Goal:** Full end-to-end QA pass of the MVP loop. No new features — find and fix bugs only.

**What was tested (code review):**

- Flow A (Solo Daily → Challenge Link): `/play/[barCount]` writing phase, checklist, live highlights, post-submit preview, Challenge Friends room creation — all code paths verified correct.
- Flow B (Friend joins Challenge Link): join route allows WRITING+CHALLENGE_LINK, barLines init effect fires on `hasJoined`, canvas+checklist render after init — correct.
- Flow C (Ranked voting): `ChallengeLiveView` vote tap/submit, delete-and-recreate re-ranking, Borda count computation, final results — correct.
- Flow D (Group Room): LOBBY → WRITING → VOTING → REVEAL state machine, host-only controls, LateArrivalView for mid-game joins — correct.

**Bug found and fixed: Submission label mismatch in voting views** (`app/room/[roomCode]/page.tsx`)

- **Root cause:** `VotingView` and `ChallengeLiveView` labeled cards using the overall `submissions` array index `i`. The rank progress display used index within non-own submissions (`otherSubs`). When the viewer's own submission appeared at index 0, other submissions got labeled "Submission B, C" on cards but "A, B" in rankings — directly contradictory.
- **Fix (VotingView):** Extracted `nonOwnSubs = submissions.filter(s => !s.isOwnSubmission)` before the map; used `nonOwnSubs.findIndex` for both the rank progress and card labels. Also replaced the inline `.filter().findIndex()` chain in the rank progress with the pre-computed `nonOwnSubs`.
- **Fix (ChallengeLiveView):** `otherSubs` was already defined at the top of the component; changed card map to use `otherSubs.findIndex(s => s.id === sub.id)` for the label instead of `i`.

**TypeScript:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — clean both before and after fix.

**What passed:**
1. TypeScript — clean ✓
2. Next.js build — clean ✓
3. Checklist present in all three writing states ✓
4. Live highlights logic — correct ✓
5. Challenge Friends creation — correct ✓
6. Join route — allows CHALLENGE_LINK in WRITING state ✓
7. Submit flow — isValid guard prevents empty bar submission ✓
8. Ranked voting re-ranking (CHALLENGE_LINK delete-and-recreate) — correct ✓
9. Borda count placement computation — correct ✓
10. Clipboard fallbacks in both views — correct ✓
11. No manual Start Voting for CHALLENGE_LINK — confirmed ✓

**What failed (fixed):**
- Submission labels "Submission B/C" on cards but "#1 A/#2 B" in ranking progress — fixed.

**Known limitations (pre-existing, not new):**
- No browser-based UI testing (no running server/browser). Code review only.
- AI checks (metaphor, punchline, callback) are heuristic placeholders — Phase 5B.
- DB not connected locally; `pnpm db:push` still pending.
- Live highlights may misalign on very long bars (60+ chars) past overflow.
